Friendly entity personalities, which for player entity save through playthroughs unless reset by Samwise. (Keep levels/gear but find at later merc recruit points bc higher level?)
Self personality based on dialogue(or other) decisions. Gives access/restricts access to other dialogue options, or influences success rate e.g. You are too kind of a person for this dialogue option, or notoriety based things( though notoriety would reset upon waking unlike personality)
Example dialogue result: +1 Carefree, Max 25. The result of this dialogue choice would give the player +1 carefree (or -1 Anxious), as long as their current Care/Anx is between -25 and 25, otherwise it would have no effect. This way, to become truly high in a personality trait, you would need to find events which have high maxes, which are more important and rarer.
Certain knowledge or skills can persist through playthroughs
No transition to "town", just a safe zone on world map and procedurally generated buildings/entities/shops
Diversity in town generation
Implement in game time
implement entity age
biomes
difficulty of combat encounter based on distance from "difficulty nodes"
all types of plot nodes exude combat power on all overworld map tiles, effect lessened when tile is farther away similar to magnetic force
track player's knowledge of encountered enemy entities throughout lifetimes, such as stats if cast Scan, expected drop rates based on past yields, types of moves
biomes and plot nodes exude creatures which are added to the available random encounters (ex. randenc=True on a desert near a graveyard, potential mobs = desertBiomeMon + graveyardPlotMon)


tiles change color based on time of day
multiple save/loads
favorite reoccuring dream to load from (game seed and/or player life results)
adventuring supplies subcontainer of inventory - daily rations for adventuring, tent consumable for healing overworld or at designated locations, grappling hook, canoe, 
town junkquests to exchange lifetime for gold/xp

get testers to roleplay out a character, see what decisions they make and why, try to have those decisions linked via personality traits, that way when a player roleplays his desired way, he will quickly get a "locked in" personality via maxes and wont arbitrarily wobble between personalities so long as do not act erratically.
croudsourced roleplaying app - I implement main quest and adventure nodes as a choose-your-own-adventure style roleplay session. Users type up their personality and class/specs, then choose from premade options from initial 10 or so testers(friends) with additional option to append an existing option or input their new option. Reasoning behind their decisions will be asked at the end of each question
eternal dungeon - exponentially harder per level
base randomzied merc personality on results of playtester characters, offer
generate voronoi.lloyd WorldMap, which will be only traversable by water, with rough draft of basic mountain/river/biomes on continents
render separate maps for each continent/land_mass based on WorldMap by finding centroid and creating circle based on it, zoomed in and with a DetailFilter applied to touch up the raw biome input
Towns = CorePlotTowns and ProcGenTowns, Dungeons = CorePlotDungeons and ProcGenDungeons, PointOfInterest = Towns and Dungeons and 
Zooming In: WorldMap -> Continent[x] -> PointOfInterest[y] -> (Building[i] or Dungeon[j]) -> Subfloor[i or j]
WorldMap <-> CombatEncounter <-> Continent <-> PointOfInterest
