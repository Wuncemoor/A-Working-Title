# Wuncemoor: The Eternal Dream

THIS GAME IS CURRENTLY ON HOLD WHILE PARTS OF THE CODE ARE REPURPOSED INTO A GAME ENGINE (TO BE USED BY THIS GAME)

Roguelike RPG - Dungeons & Dragons meets Dragon Quest meets Groundhog Day

You live in a small village, grow up with your friends, marry your childhood sweetheart, and grow old. It seemed like a good life... until the fire nation attacked. As everything burns, you wake up. You're 10 years old again, back at the orphanage. Was it all a dream? No, a premonition of things to come, and now you have a lifetime to prepare.


Permadeath - When your allies die they are gone; when you die you wake back up and start over

Procedurally generated - Never the same game twice; learn from your mistakes and die more creatively next time

Turn Based Gameplay - Take all the time you need to make the best move

"Time" management - Major actions cost time. Waste too much time and you'll grow old without ever being a hero

Customization - Level and equip your hero and allies to fit the world you're living in.

Nonlinear plot - The decisions you make matter.

...and much more!

Currently in pre-alpha so only posting source code. Will release an executable once it's in alpha.

Written in Python using the PyGame, tcod, and OpenSimplex libraries
