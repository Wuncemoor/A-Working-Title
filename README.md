# Wuncemoor: The Eternal Dream

Roguelike RPG - Dungeons & Dragons meets Dragon Quest meets Groundhog Day

You live in a small village, grow up with your friends, marry your childhood sweetheart, and grow old. It seemed like a good life... until the fire nation attacked. They burn your village and kill everyone you've ever known. As you die, you wake up. You're 10 years old again, back at the orphanage. Was it all a dream? No, a premonition of things to come, and now you have a lifetime to prepare.


Permadeath - When your allies die they are gone; when you die you wake back up and start over

Procedurally generated - Never the same game twice; learn from your mistakes and die more creatively next time

Turn Based Gameplay - Take all the time you need to make the best move

"Time" management - Major actions cost time. Waste too much time and you'll grow old without ever being a hero

Customization - Level and equip your hero and allies to fit the world you're living in.

Nonlinear gameplay - The decisions you make matter.

...and much more!

Currently in pre-alpha so only posting source code. Will release an executable once it's in alpha.
